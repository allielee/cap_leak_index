# cap_leak_index
Study to test if capillary leak index (CLI) is a marker of severity of illness in sepsis.  
 - Sepsis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality
 - Capillary leak, the escape of protein-rich fluid leaks out of vessels into organs, is an important part of sepsis
 - CLI can be estimated by the change in hematocrit after IV fluids
 - Changes in hematocrit would be inversely proportional to the degree of capillary leak  
   
_Null hypothesis: septic patients with a high CLI will have the same risk for morbidity and mortality as patients with a low CLI_
 - Cohort: patients w/ sepsis (eICU database)
_ Exposure: CLI (quartiles of severity)
_ Outcome: in-hospital mortality
